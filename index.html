    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="section-description">I'm an Eletrical Engineer studying at Texas A&M University with a passion for
      Computer Science which is why I made this website. It's my way of learning html and css while being able to use my
      previous knowledge of javascript . All the different things that are in this website was learned in the time that
      I made this website. I'll continue to improve this website as I learn more about the options that are in store for
      me for to better improve this website. </div>

    <div class="section-description">Personal Website - <a href="https://github.com/kevinliu03/kevinliu03.github"

    <p>This is the current website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <div class="section-description">Chess Extension - <a href="https://github.com/kevinliu03/Chess-Extension"
        class="repository" target="_blank">Github Repository</a></div>
    <p>This is an extension that I made for Chess.com that adds a button to easily import a player's game to Lichess
      after a game is finished. This allows a player to game review the game that they just played with the
      assistance of Stock Fish which is the strongest game engine for chess. This was made in JavaScript.</p>
    <div class="section-description">TAMU Registration Extension - <a
        href="https://github.com/kevinliu03/TAMU-Registration-Extension" class="repository" target="_blank">Github
        Repository</a></div>
    <p>This is an extension that I made for students to check for ratings on rate my professor. Most students
      would use Rate My Professor to decide on if they would register for that class. I noticed that everytime a
      student would need to find a professor it would take atleast a few seconds to search the professor up. These
      few seconds add up once you see that there are multiple professors for each class and a student would be
      take more than one class. This extension was coded in JavaScript.</p>
